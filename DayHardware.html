				<h2>Processors</h2>
				<p>Prioritization is a handy skill to have, no where is it more important than in computers. In every second, a computer will have to make thousands of decisions about what to do and when to do it. To help do this speedily a computer relies on its processor. The central processing unit, or the CPU, sends commands to other parts of the computer on what input to accept, output to produce, and what programs to run. A CPU has four primary functions: fetch, decode, execute, and writeback.</p>
				<p>Put shortly, the CPU is like a brain, and like brains, not all of them go at the same speed. The speed of a CPU is measured by Megahertz or MHz. 1 MHz would be a calculation of about 1,000,000 computer instructions a second. Gigahertz are made up of a thousand MHz. Because it is at the heart of your computer and does some of the most important things, it is also usually the most expensive part of the computer. Two companies primarily make these computer brains, AMD and intel. CPUs are not unique to laptops and computers as they can also be found in DVD players and phones.</p>
				<p>A CPU will often be classified by how many cores it has. It isn’t very common for a CPU to be made up of a single component anymore as it is usually made up of multiple cores. Most phones and computers run off of a dual-core CPU, but some devices can be made up of quad-cores, or octa-cores. Basically this means that the CPU is made up of more than just 1 processor, it’s made up of many. The advantage of having a dual-core as opposed to a single core CPU is that more energy can be saved by splitting the commands between two processors rather than load all of the commands onto one processor.</p>
