	<h2>Charles Babbage Invents the First Computer</h2>

		<p>It may come as a surprise to find that the first computer was created before electricity was distributed out as a common household resource. In 1832, a Cambridge University Mathematics teacher by the name of Charles Babbage designed something he called a “difference engine”. In fact, he had designed the world’s first mechanical computer or perhaps it is fairer to say he invented the world’s first calculator. This engine was completely hand operated, could calculate complex mathematical problems, and even print out the results. The only problem was that the machine was estimated to be the size of a room, weighing in at about 4 tons. Though he initially had funding support from the British government, the intricacy of the metal work required to make the machine a reality was too expensive. Babbage also had plans to create another machine that more resembles a modern-day computer (“The Analytical Machine” as it is called in his blueprint notes), he lacked the funds and resources to finish the project. Truly, Babbage was a man far ahead of his time. Had he been born a hundred years later there would have been no problem at all to fund his projects!</p>

	<h2>Steve Jobs and the First Personalized Computers</h2>

		<p>Nowadays personal computers are as common in American households as are cars or television sets, but there was a time when computers were not part of the household. It wasn’t until the 1970’s that computers were advertised to the average American household. This is in large part due to the overwhelming size and underwhelming quantity of computers in the world up to that point. Thanks to the development of microchips, computers were beginning to be produced in a manageable size, allowing for computer hobbyists to fiddle around on something that would’ve cost millions of dollar in the 50’s for a small fraction of the price. In 1977, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak designed the first computer intended to be used by anyone and everyone, the Apple II. The Apple II boasted several features that made it desirable for the common household, such as a full color display, sound, several floppy disk drives, and it also included a keyboard. These features may seem normal for today’s standards, but back then it was absolutely revolutionary.</p>

	<h2>The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</h2>

		<p>Though it was not the first video game machine created, that honor goes to Home Pong made by Atari in 1974, the revival and universal success of videogame consoles can be attributed to the Nintendo Entertainment System. In 1985, Atari experienced a rapid decline in sales and was facing bankruptcy, going from 3.2 billion dollars in sales in 1983 to a mere 100 million by 1985 (a 97% decrease). This is because there was so much competition in the market for a home videogame console, split between Atari, Intellivision, Colecovision, and many, many others. This coupled with producers producing cheap, quick games for a quick buck turned consumers away. Enter the NES. The NES was much like the other competition in design in that you could change out game cartridges, but was unique in others. For one, third-party developer freedom was severely limited thanks to the NES’ checking integrated circuit (CIC) which prevented unauthorized third party developers to produce low quality games on the NES. All games that were made for the NES were usually exclusive and of much higher quality than Atari games. Secondly, the controller was simple in design and featured a d-pad, the first of its kind, and two action buttons and a pause button. The game released alongside the purchase of a NES is fondly remembered as the video game that saved all videogames, Super Mario Bros. Nintendo went on to become the one major player in the gaming industry for almost a decade before SEGA hit the seen. The success of videogames as part of a home console would later influence the designs of future home computers that could actually support more visually and mechanically complex games.</p>
