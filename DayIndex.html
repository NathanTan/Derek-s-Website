<p>Hello, my name is Derek Day. You may be wondering why my website looks so bland. Well, it is because I'm figuring all of this out on my lonesome!
Thanks to a little help from my friend who has the luxury of having a person over his shoulder teaching him, I too can be a computer genius. 
<p>If you are curious, the picture above is me put through an "ACID" filter. I thought it was kinda funky. I took it about two years ago when I was out thrift shopping on hawthorne. By happenstance, the photo was taken just about when I needed to turn in a Senior Photo for my High School Year book. Good thing I chose NOT to use this picture, that would've embarrassed my grandmother to no end</p>
<p>It has been a while since High School, but I still love to look back on this picture and remember how weird I was, how weird I still am. Not a lot has changed, though. I still love listening to Jazz, watching Korean's duke it out in StarCraft, play chess, and draw to my heart's content. I have tried to expand my music library, but I'm still working on it.</p> 
<p>For fun, I want to post something here that I love, which is Chinese History. Specifically, the Three Kingdoms Period around 200 AD, an era that I did extensive research for for my History Report during my senior year. I also want to share something I wrote about Ancient Greek history in Alexander the Great. I love history, what can I say? </p>
			   	
				<h2><center>The Three Kingdom Period</center></h2>
<ol>“By the middle of the second century AD, the Han dynasty was bankrupt, not only in economic terms, but socially and politically as well.” (George Ernest Morrison)</ol>
<ol>“The dominance of gentry families in the political society of Later Han had brought a general expectation that local and national authority was reserved to men of lineage.” (Rafe de Crespigny)</ol>
<ol>Cao Cao had connections to the Eunuchs of the court, but his family was of no real importance (Sanguozhi)</ol>	
<ol>Cao Cao was described as “a bad subject in times of peace, a hero in times of trouble” (Sanguozhi)</ol>
<ol>In 189 AD, September 24, Dong Zhou, a powerful warlord, marched his army into the capital 	city of Luoyang and claimed power as the chancellor of China (Rafe de Crespigny)</ol>
<ol>After a decade of civil war throughout China in response to Dong Zhou's actions, “Cao Cao emerged in triumph. He established a coherent government with the Emperor as his puppet, and by 200 AD,
when he defeated his chief rival in battle by the Yellow River, he was the master of north China” (George Ernest Morrison)</ol> 		
<ol>In 208, Cao Cao and his forces marched south to the Yangzi River in the Jing province to face against the allied forces of Sun Quan, who had territories in south east China which he inherited from his warlord father, and Liu Bei, a sandal weaver turned warlord who claimed ancestry to the royal Liu family that founded the Han Dynasty.</ol>
<ol>Although Cao Cao's military numbers greatly outnumbered the alliance, Cao Cao's forces were ultimately defeated at the Battle of Red Cliff. (Sima Guang, 34)</ol>
<ol>“The Red Cliffs campaign was the last chance for many years to re-unite the empire, for it was control of the middle Yangzi which meant the difference between survival and surrender in the south” (Rafe de Crespigny)</ol> 	
<ol>This resulted in the formation of the Three Kingdoms, Wei under Cao Cao, Shu under Liu Bei, and Wu under Sun Quan. They waged war to unify China from 220-280.</ol>

				<h3><center>Analysis/Understanding of Plutarch's Alexander the Great</center></h3>
<p>Alexander was naturally inquisitive and adventurous by nature and these characteristics led him under the teachings of the most famous philosopher of the time, Aristotle. Even before his twentieth year, ambassadors from the King of Persia were impressed by Alexander’s intelligent questioning of their kingdom’s military prowess, giving him their complete admiration over his father, Philip II. Not even his father could keep Alexander pacified under his order, as Alexander would only listen to reason and had to be persuaded. A good example of Alexander’s adventurous spirit and keen understanding is his taming of the wild horse Bucephalas, who no one could mount (The Life of Alexander page 1). Despite the doubts of his father and his grooms, who were just about to cast the horse away, Alexander was able to calm the animal using his gentle hand. Where others saw the impossible, Alexander saw opportunity. Alexander was highly independent and impressive in his young age and was just as curious as he was hot headed. It was for this reason that Philip thought it best to have Alexander learn under Aristotle, because Alexander’s education required, as Sophocles puts it, “the rudder’s guidance and the curb’s restraint”. In other words, Alexander could be led in the right direction when given the right reason, but he also needed a teacher who could help make his path clear, if not a little restrictive (The Life of Alexander page 2). Philip made certain to reward Aristotle generously, giving him the temple of the Nymphs near Mieza to teach his son and even freeing the peoples whom he enslaved from the philosopher’s native city, Stageira. It was at this temple that Alexander learned the principles of ethics and politics, though I am certain that Aristotle’s Athenian, democratic background was withheld in light of his pupil’s future role of the monarch of Macedonia. According to Plutarch, Alexander would have also learned as a special student, who received lessons only given to “a select circle of the initiated”. The most important thing that Aristotle would leave Alexander would be his annotated reading of the Iliad, a handbook of the art of war which Alexander would carry with him on his conquests. Surely, Aristotle helped nourish Alexander’s affinity towards philosophy, as Alexander would continue to grow on his journeys.</p>
